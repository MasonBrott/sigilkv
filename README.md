# SigilKV

## Overview

SigilKV is a basic key-value store implemented in Go. Its design is inspired by the concepts presented in the book "Cloud Native Go" by Matthew Titmus.

This key-value store is being developed as a component of a larger project aimed at building a detection engine. This engine will utilize Sigma rules to generate alerts based on log data ingested into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Logging. SigilKV will serve as a storage mechanism within this system.
